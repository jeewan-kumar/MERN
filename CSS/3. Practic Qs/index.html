    <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
    <h3>by percy bysshe shelley</h3>
    <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br/>
        who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs or stone" <br>
        stand in the desert.... Near them, on the sand, <br>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br>
        and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
        tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
        which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
        the hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br>
        and on the pedestal, those word appear:  “My friend, <br>
        my brother!’—“In what distant quarters of the world <br>
        shall we two meet again?”—I  replied, “Nevermore.”<br>
        My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, king of kings;<br>
    </p>
